BrainFreeze is the software side of a computer-brain interface product.
The product's hardware side constantly produces cognition snapshots of the user,
sent to BrainFreeze system for processing and analysis.
A cognition snapshot consists of:

- the user's **location** and head's **rotation** (combining those forms the user's **'pose'**)
- the **color image** that the user saw
- the **depth image** that the user saw (the distance of the nearest object in each point of the user's view)
- the **timestamp** the snapshot was taken at

To simulate the hardware side, you are supplied with a binary file (see "Usage" page under 'client'),
containing the user's basic information and a list of their cognition snapshots taken
in the morning hours of April 4th, 2019.

The software side, i.e. BrainFreeze system and its components, is further explained in the usage page.
