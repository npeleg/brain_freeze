------

    The client component is responsible for sending the user's information and cognition snapshots,
    found in a binary file, to a server.
    The reading of the binary file is done using a 'reader' component (see below).

    Uploading the binary file to server is simple:
    .. upload_sample::
    ``from brain_freeze.client import upload_sample``
    ``upload_sample(host= '127.0.0.1' , port= 8000 , path= './sample/sample.mind.gz' )``
    ``uploading... # upload path to host : port``
